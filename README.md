# Personal Webiste
I am creating my personal website to document and showcase my work and my hobbies. This is my first time drafting a website from scratch using HTML and CSS after watching a crashing course. The website is designed with Figma. This website is hosted with Namecheap. You can find the website at [boyazhang.org](boyazhang.org)

# Blog
Since I am starting my first research position at KMUTT this summer (2025), I wanted to incentivize myself to find meaning in my work and share my knowledge. Therefore, I am starting a blog page on my website where I will post my research progress regularly.
